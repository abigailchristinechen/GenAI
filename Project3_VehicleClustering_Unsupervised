# Vehicle Clustering (Unsupervised Learning)
# Scenario - You are working for an automotive company, and your task is to cluster vehicles into groups based on their features such as weight, engine size, and horsepower.

#Cluster Visualization - The scatter plot will visually depict how vehicles are grouped based on weight and horsepower. Each cluster will be represented by a different color. With synthetic data, the distinctness of clusters may vary, but students should be able to see groupings based on the chosen features.
# Interpreting Clusters - There are no 'correct' labels in unsupervised learning, but students should observe how vehicles are grouped based on similarities in their features. They might see, for example, that heavier vehicles with higher horsepower are grouped together.

    'Horsepower': np.random.randint(50, 300, data_size)
}

# No labels are needed for unsupervised learning
X = df

# Perform KMeans clustering

# Plotting the clusters
